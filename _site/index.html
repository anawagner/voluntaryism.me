When you think about the future, what do you see?
</p><p>
When I played high school football, as an inside linebacker. I used to dream
of seeing the guard in front of me stand up. It’s a pass! I’d drop to the
outside looking for the tight end, then move to cover the flat if he wasn’t
coming into my area. I always pictured the quarterback trying to dump the ball
to the tight end on a quick slant. Except, I’d be there to steal the pass and
have an open lane to run into the end zone with the opposing team nipping at
my heels as I crossed the goal line.

Have you ever been excited about a new technology?  Certainly we all still use snail mail in some form or another when there is no other choice.  But email has vastly replaced dropping letters in mailboxes.  And I doubt too many of us still use an encyclopedia when we want to learn about a subject these days.
</p><p>
There is a new technology out there that is revolutionizing the way people live.  This technology will save people vast amounts of time.  Making life an order of magnitude easier for all people, all over the world.  I’m going to teach those of you willing to learn how to use this incredibly, wonderfully, creatively destructive technology known as Bitcoin.

If I told you that you own yourself, would you disagree?
</p><p>
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to make the argument that, in the first place, we all own ourselves.  In fact, if you disagree with me, you are only providing evidence that you do.  From that point, I'll trace how, if we own ourselves, we must own our actions.  Thirdly, if we own our actions we must own the results of those actions. In the end, if we are able to interact with each other, voluntarily, without resorting to coercion, everyone will find themselves in a better situation.

Please allow me to introduce myself, my name is James Wagner, and I’m an Anarchist.
</p><p>
Well, if I have your attention because you’re afraid I’m going to toss a Molotov cocktail your way, there is no need to worry. All that I mean when I say that I’m an anarchist is that I think that all human interactions should be voluntary. I stand against the initiation of the use of force, or any type of coercion, for that matter. The meaning of the word Anarchist is synonymous with Voluntaryist and represents the thought that nobody should rule over anyone else. In other words, nobody has a legitimate right to initiate force or otherwise coerce others to do anything.
